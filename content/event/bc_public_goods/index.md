summary: A presentation on two theories of (de)centralization and local public goods provision.
abstract: "Tiebout (1956)'s theory of local public goods provision suggests that decentralized municipal competition leads to an optimal goods provision. However, when Tiebout's strong theoretical assumptions are relaxed, final allocations are subject to a variety of inefficiencies. This presentation covers Oates (1972) and Besley and Coate (2003) to explore coordination failures, preference matching failures, uncertainty, misallocation, and strategic delegation in the context of decentralized and centralized public goods provision."
