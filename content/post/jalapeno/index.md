## Overview

I love making guacamole, and I like it to have a nice spicy kick. So, when I'm in the kitchen, I dice entire jalapeños and toss them in with all the other ingredients. But, I know not everyone enjoys a spicy guac, and I'm happy to carve out the jalapeño seeds to make a mild guacamole that still has some jalapeño flavor.

I was once asked how big of a difference jalapeño seeds make to a guac's spice level. To answer this question, I roped my family into my semester project for [Dr. Donald Green's](https://polisci.columbia.edu/content/donald-p-green) Experimental Research course. For the fine details of the project, follow the link to my project page. In the future, I will update this post to include a summary of the RCT findings. Though, the short answer is: If you like spicy guacamole keep the jalapeño seeds, if you want a mild version use a jalapeño for flavor, but first carve out the seeds.

## Recipe

This blog post would not be complete without including my guacamole recipe.
- 3 Hass avocados (diced and mashed)
- 1/2 large Vidalia onion (diced)
- 1 medium tomato (diced) Remove insides to prevent guacamole from becoming watery
- 2 jalapeños (diced)
- 2 cloves of garlic (diced)
- 1 lime (squeezed for the juice)
- Mix the ingredients thoroughly in a bowl, and add salt to taste
- Variants: (1) Low Spice – remove the seeds and pith from the jalapeño, (2) Moderate
Spice – remove the jalapeño seeds but keep the pith, (3) Spicy – entire jalapeño.
- Note: The recipe scales nicely for larger servings.
