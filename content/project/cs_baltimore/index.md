In 2018, I worked as the Fiscal Analyst for the Baltimore City Council. In this role, one of my first projects was to produce a cost benefit analysis of a bill (Bill 17-0102) that would require the city to develop a "Complete Streets" design guide.

A “complete street” is one designed to meet the multimodal transportation needs of a community. Community needs may include economic, health, equity and safety goals or concerns. To successfully accomplish complete streets priorities, a city may pass legislation, adopt a street design guide, identify external funding sources, implement low cost short-term complete street elements, budget for more expensive permanent complete street elements, track relevant data, and apply accountability procedures. (For a quick introduction to complete streets policy, see [Smart Growth America's](https://smartgrowthamerica.org/what-are-complete-streets/) complete streets primer.)

To evaluate the cost and feasibility of the bill, I consulted budget and transportation experts in peer cities, reviewed Baltimore budget data, and read numerous reports from transportation industry specialists. I also reviewed a wide range of Baltimore planning reports which identified a multimodal transportation policy as a necessary requirement for achieving the city's long-term equity and climate goals. In under a month, I produced a 58 page report that synthesizing my research and recommended the adoption of Bill 17-0102.
