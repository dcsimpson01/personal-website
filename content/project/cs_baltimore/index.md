In 2018, I worked as the Fiscal Analyst for the Baltimore City Council. In this role, one of my first projects was to produce a cost benefit analysis of a bill (Bill 17-0102) that would require the city to develop a "Complete Streets" design guide.

A “complete street” is one designed to meet the multimodal transportation needs of a community. Community needs may include economic, health, equity and safety goals or concerns. To successfully accomplish complete streets priorities, a city may pass legislation, adopt a street design guide, identify external funding sources, implement low cost short-term complete street elements, budget for more expensive permanent complete street elements, track relevant data, and apply accountability procedures. 

To evaluate the cost and feasibility of the bill, I consulted budget and transportation experts in peer cities, reviewed Baltimore budget data, and read numerous reports from transportation industry specialists. I also reviewed a wide range of Baltimore planning reports which identified a multimodal transportation policy as a necessary requirement for achieving the city's long-term equity and climate goals. In under a month, I produced a 58 page report that synthesizing my research and recommended the adoption of Bill 17-0102.

The report was one of many steps in the adoption of a complete streets design manual in Baltimore. Community advocates, organizers and groups including [Bikemore](https://www.bikemore.net) played the essential role of putting complete streets on the legislative agenda in the city council in 2017. The bill was [passed](https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-complete-streets-20181206-story.html) in late 2018. Baltimore's adopted complete streets design manual is available [here](https://transportation.baltimorecity.gov/completestreets).
