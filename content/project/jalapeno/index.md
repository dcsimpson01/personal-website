## Overview

This is the project page for my fun, yet academic, guacamole RCT. I used [Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/) to collect participant survey responses regarding the taste profiles of different guacamole types. I then used R to process and analyze the survey data. To develop the experiment, I relied on [*Field Experiments: Design, Analysis and Interpretation*](https://isps.yale.edu/FEDAI) by Dr. Alan Gerber and Donald Green.

The top of the page includes links to the pdf of my report, as well as a link to my R code. Below, you can find a link to my pre-analysis plan.
